MQTT bridge between Bluetti and Home Assistant.

This is a simple Home Assistant add-on for [bluetti_mqtt](https://github.com/LzbnAndr313/bluetti2mqtt) which is a fork of [bluetti_mqtt](https://github.com/warhammerkid/bluetti_mqtt).

This add-on was forked from [bluetti_mqtt](https://github.com/warhammerkid/bluetti_mqtt) and created as an easy method to get Bluetti data into Home Assistant, without having to setup [bluetti_mqtt](https://github.com/warhammerkid/bluetti_mqtt) on a separate device.
